# Study on the brain mechanism in visual assistance for the blind
## abstract
There are a very few people have the ability to “see” the surroundings by the echoes, which is called echolocation. The study of the brain mechanism of echolocation can not only help to improve the blind assistance device, but also provides a window into the research of brain's plasticity. In this presented paper, we developed a wearable system to transform the spatial information captured by camera into a voice description and feed it back to users which is inspired by echolocation. After training, users can sense the surroundings by using the acoustic feedbacks from the blind assisting device. Compared with natural echolocation, it’s easier to learn and be applied in daily life. In addition, the device achieves higher resolution. In this study, two trained blind subjects and two non-trained sighted volunteers were tested by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We obtain the fMRI images of subjects’ brain activity when they were listening to the sound of the wearable prototype. Intriguingly, we find that after training with the blind assistance system, the blind’ visual area of the brain have been activated when they are dealing with the acoustic feedback from the device.
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background
Bats are known to sense their surroundings by the echoes of ultrasonic sound that they emit. In fact, bats comprehend the echo signal by some  rules. For example, bats would judge the place without the return of sound wave in front of them as an passage [1], while places without the return of sound wave on the horizontal ground would be considered as water surface by bats [2]. Research has shown that some people, like bats, are able to use reflected sound waves to sense the surroundings.
