# Shape conveyed by visual- to-auditory sensory substitution activates the lateral occipital complex

## Abstract
The _lateral-occipital tactile-visual area (LOtv)_ (侧枕叶 触觉-视觉 皮层) is activated when objects are recognized by vision or touch. 

Recognizing objects by their typical sounds or learning to associate specific soundscapes with specific objects do not activate this region.
>G：可以添加声音对比训练。让被试听和特定物体联系的声音，看看会不会产生反应。

## Main context


### fMRI
Brain-Voyager QX1.8 
standard preprocessing procedure and a fixed-effects general linear model.
**occipito-temporal cortex (枕颞皮层)**: only vOICe experts show robust activation
**parietal cortex (顶叶皮层) (intraparietal sulcus, IPS)**: common clusters of activation
